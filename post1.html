      <p>In today's digital storm, staying creative is harder than ever. Notifications, deadlines, distractions â€” they steal our attention and smother our ideas.</p>

      <p>But creativity is not a luxury. Itâ€™s a muscle. And with the right routines, you can train your mind to stay inspired, no matter how chaotic life gets.</p>

      <h2>1. Make Space for Boredom</h2>
      <p>We often fear boredom, yet itâ€™s the birthplace of imagination. Turn off your devices for 10 minutes a day and let your mind wander. Your best ideas are waiting in the silence.</p>

      <h2>2. Schedule Unstructured Time</h2>
      <p>Block out 20 minutes daily to just create â€” no expectations, no goals. Draw, write, brainstorm, sing â€” anything. These moments of freedom become fuel for deeper creativity.</p>

      <blockquote>"Creativity doesnâ€™t need a canvas. It needs permission."</blockquote>

      <h2>3. Curate Your Inputs</h2>
      <p>Your output is only as good as your input. Follow creators who inspire you. Read books that challenge you. Listen to music that stirs something in you.</p>

      <div class="tip-box fade-in">
        <h3>âš¡ Quick Tip:</h3>
        <p>Start a "creativity journal." Every night, write one idea â€” no matter how silly. In 30 days, youâ€™ll have a treasure chest of imagination.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>4. Turn Routine into Ritual</h2>
      <p>Brush your teeth with your non-dominant hand. Walk a new route home. Challenge your brain in small ways â€” it will reward you with fresh perspectives.</p>

      <h2>5. Surround Yourself With Inspiration</h2>
      <p>Create a physical or digital "inspiration corner" â€” a folder or space with photos, quotes, and visuals that spark ideas instantly.</p>

      <h2>6. Be Okay With Imperfection</h2>
      <p>Perfection kills creativity. Focus on creating, not controlling. Share your work even when it feels unfinished. Thatâ€™s where the magic lives.</p>

      <p>Remember: you don't need a perfect environment â€” just a consistent one. Make creativity a habit, and it will show up even on your hardest days.</p>
