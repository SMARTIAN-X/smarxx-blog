    <div class="post-content">
      <p>Our lives are overflowing with notifications, subscriptions, feeds, and content we didnâ€™t ask for. Digital minimalism is about reclaiming your time, focus, and peace in a hyper-connected world.</p>

      <h2>1. What is Digital Minimalism?</h2>
      <p>Itâ€™s a philosophy that encourages intentional technology use. Instead of mindlessly consuming, you mindfully choose what adds value â€” and cut the rest.</p>

      <blockquote>"Clutter is not just stuff on your floor. Itâ€™s anything that gets between you and the life you want to be living." â€“ Peter Walsh</blockquote>

      <h2>2. Audit Your Apps</h2>
      <p>Which apps drain you? Which serve you? Delete the ones that offer no purpose or joy. Turn off non-essential notifications. Keep your phone clean â€” mentally and visually.</p>

      <h2>3. Curate Your Digital Spaces</h2>
      <p>Your social media feeds, email subscriptions, and home screen should reflect your values. Follow creators who uplift you. Unfollow noise. Create calm with intention.</p>

      <div class="tip-box fade-in">
        <h3>ðŸ“± Try This Challenge:</h3>
        <p>For 7 days, use only essential apps. No social media. Track how your focus, energy, and creativity change.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>4. Create Before You Consume</h2>
      <p>Donâ€™t let your first hour be spent reacting to the world. Journal. Write. Sketch. Move. Make something â€” even if small â€” before you scroll.</p>

      <h2>5. Embrace Boredom</h2>
      <p>Boredom sparks imagination. When you cut screen time, your mind begins to wander and wonder. Thatâ€™s where the magic happens.</p>

      <h2>6. Reconnect Offline</h2>
      <p>Digital minimalism makes room for analog beauty â€” handwritten notes, long walks, undistracted conversations, and real presence.</p>

      <p class="ending-quote fade-in">ðŸŒ¿ <em>"Simplify your tech. Reconnect with life. Minimalism isnâ€™t less â€” itâ€™s space for what matters."</em></p>
